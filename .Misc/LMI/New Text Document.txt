There are some software packages (something like libraries and modules) as a high level programming interface using MATLAB as modeling language, to solve optimization problems. Some notable examples are:

1. MATLAB native LMI Toolbox
2. YALMIP
3. CVX
4 ...

using these packages you can program/model/formulate your optimization problem. After that, These are high-level packages use "solvers" to solve that problem. Therefore, these packages rely on external solvers for the low-level numerical solution of optimization problem. Depending on the nature of the problem, different types of solvers should be used. refer to "https://yalmip.github.io/allsolvers/" for a list of solvers. Some of these solvers are free and some are commercial.

install optimization package -----> install appropriate solvers

• for example in cvx, solvers include: http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html#solvers-included-with-cvx
• for example in yalmip, solvers include: https://yalmip.github.io/allsolvers/

[SDPT3] is a fairly good (also free) solver for semidifinite programming. 

YALMIP installation guide:
1. follow the installation guide at https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation/
2. choose an appropriate solver at https://yalmip.github.io/allsolvers/
3. to install sdpt3, follow the instructions at https://blog.nus.edu.sg/mattohkc/softwares/sdpt3/
