%% Story 8.3.3 of Blitzstein
%
% We have a coin that lands Heads with probability p, but we don t know what p is.
% Our goal is to infer the value of p after observing the outcomes of n tosses of 
% the coin. The larger that n is, the more accurately we should be able to estimate p.
%
% There are several ways to go about doing this. One major approach is Bayesian
% inference, which treats all unknown quantities as random variables. In the Bayesian
% approach, we would treat the unknown probability p as a random variable and give
% p a distribution. This is called a prior distribution, and it reflects our uncertainty
% about the true value of p before observing the coin tosses. After the experiment is
% performed and the data are gathered, the prior distribution is updated using Bayesâ€™
% rule; this yields the posterior distribution, which reflects our new
% beliefs about p.
